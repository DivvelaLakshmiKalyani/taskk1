<h1>Unleashing the Power of MongoDB: A Journey into the World of NoSQL Databases</h1>

        <h1 text-shadow: 2px 2px 5px red>What is MongoDB?</h1>
<h2>MongoDB is a popular document-oriented NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time without downtime.<br>
Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB allows for faster development, better performance, and easier scalability. With its flexible schema design and automatic sharding, MongoDB can easily handle large amounts of data and high traffic applications.

<h1 style:"text-shadow: 2px 2px 5px red";>Why use MongoDB?</h1>
<h2>MongoDB offers several benefits over traditional relational databases. One of the biggest advantages is its ability to scale horizontally, which means that it can handle large amounts of data and traffic without slowing down. MongoDB achieves this through sharding, a process where data is distributed across multiple servers.
Another benefit of MongoDB is its flexibility in handling unstructured data. Unlike traditional databases, MongoDB does not require a predefined schema, which makes it easier to adapt to changing data requirements. This also allows for faster development cycles and more agile data modeling.</h2>

<h1 text-shadow: 2px 2px 5px red>Nosql vs Sql</h1>
<h2>SQL databases are used to store structured data while NoSQL databases like MongoDB are used to save unstructured data. MongoDB is used to save unstructured data in JSON format.<br></h2>
<h1 text-shadow: 2px 2px 5px red>Aggregation</h1>
<h2>MongoDB's aggregation framework is a powerful tool for data analysis and manipulation. It allows users to perform complex queries on large datasets and return results in a structured format.
One of the key features of the aggregation framework is its ability to group data based on specific criteria. This can be useful for tasks such as calculating averages, finding the maximum or minimum value, or counting the number of occurrences of a particular field.

<h1 text-shadow: 2px 2px 5px red>What is data modeling?</h1>
<h2>Data modeling is the process that creates a visual representation of the data components in a system. This visual representation not only helps identify all data components, but also helps determine the relationships among data elements while finding the best way to demonstrate those relationships.<br>

MongoDB supports multiple ways to model relationships between entities:<br><gr>

One to one (1-1): In this relationship, one value is associated with only one document. For example, a book can have only one ISBN.<br>

One to many (1-N): Here, one value can be associated with more than one document or value. For example, a user can borrow more than one book at a time.<br>

Many to many (N-N): In this type of model, multiple documents can be associated with each other. For example, a book can have many authors, and one author can write many different books. The relationship between author and book is many to many.

<h1 text-shadow: 2px 2px 5px red>Querying MongoDB</h1>
<h2>MongoDB Query Language (MQL) is a powerful tool for querying data in MongoDB.<br>
MQL uses a JSON-like syntax and supports a wide range of operators and functions to filter, sort, and manipulate data.<br>
In the Filter field, enter a filter document. You can use all of the MongoDB 
query operators
 except the 
$text
 and 
$expr
 operators.<br><br>
The following filter returns documents that have a title value of Jurassic Park:
<h1>{ "title": "Jurassic Park" }</h1><h2>

<h2> MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database solution that suits modern development requirements. In this tutorial,I've covered the basics of MongoDB, the Mongo shell and some of the popular drivers available. We've also explored the common database operations and CRUD actions within the Mongo shell.</h2>
